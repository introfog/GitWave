## <img src="./src/main/resources/logo32.png"  alt="GitWave Logo"> Overview
Welcome to GitWave – the ultimate tool for developers who work with multiple repositories on Windows. GitWave is 
designed to streamline your workflow by allowing you to run any bash commands across several repositories simultaneously.
It’s a powerful companion for any developer looking to save time and effort when managing their Git projects.

## :sparkles: Features
### 1. Multi-Repository Command Execution
Execute bash commands in multiple repositories with a single command, making it easier to manage complex workflows.
### 2. Command Management
Save your most used or tricky commands with notes, so you never have to remember the syntax again. 
Specify `{parameters}` for the command, to quickly run different scenarios.
### 3. Standalone Application
GitWave is a standalone application that doesn't leave any footprint on your PC. It respects your 
system's cleanliness by ensuring that no unnecessary files or configurations are left behind, 
providing a hassle-free and straightforward experience for users.
### 4. Open Source
GitWave is an open-source project, that encourages collaboration and community involvement. 
Explore, contribute, and customize the application according to your preferences.

## :checkered_flag: Getting Started
To enjoy GitWave you don't need any JDK, because it already includes JDK.
1. Download `GitWave.zip` from the [latest release](https://github.com/introfog/GitWave/releases).
2. Unpack archive to your local machine and launch `GitWave.exe`.
3. Begin executing bash commands across multiple repositories effortlessly.
4. You can check my personal [GitWave config](https://gist.github.com/introfog/10a0a3f6c0b069c4132f8ac18b73dff5) with bash commands which i use on regular basis.

## :hammer: Build Locally
### Software Requirements
- JDK 11 or higher.
- Maven.
### Build Options
- To run the application execute `mvn javafx:run`.
- To create ready to use app, archived into .zip, run `mvn package`. GitWave will be in `target/GitWave.zip` archive.
  - `GitWave.exe`, which runs java image, is located in the `tools` folder and generated by a separate C++ project `tools/GitWaveExecutor`.
 
## :gear: Under the hood
- GitWave is built on openjdk 11 + openjfx 11 and wrapped into Java Runtime Image.
- All commands and settings are stored in `config/config.json` in JSON format. So it is possible to edit them manually in any text editor.
- On opening the app makes a lenient request to GitHub API to check for the new available release, see `com.github.introfog.gitwave.model.UpdateChecker#isNewReleaseAvailable`.
- The `temp` folder is used to save bash scripts to run, they are automatically removed after the command completes.

## :bulb: Ideas For Further Releases
- Allow working with the app by using only the keyboard (with correct Tabs, Esc and so on work).
- Exclude sub-directories from the command running.
- Allow export and import config.
- Release version for Linux and macOS.
