### 3. Standalone Application

system's cleanliness by ensuring that no unnecessary files or configurations are left behind, 
providing a hassle-free and straightforward experience for users.

## :hammer: Build Locally
### Software Requirements
- JDK 11 or higher.
- Maven.
### Build Options
- To run the application execute `mvn javafx:run`.
- To create ready to use app, archived into .zip, run `mvn package`. GitWave will be in `target/GitWave.zip` archive.
  - `GitWave.exe`, which runs java image, is located in the `tools` folder and generated by a separate C++ project `tools/GitWaveExecutor`.
 
## :gear: Under the hood
- GitWave is built on openjdk 11 + openjfx 11.
- All commands and settings are stored in `config/config.json` in JSON format. So it is possible to edit them manually in any text editor.
- On opening the app makes a lenient request to GitHub API to check for the new available release, see `com.github.introfog.gitwave.model.UpdateChecker#isNewReleaseAvailable`.
- The `temp` folder is used to save bash scripts to run, they are automatically removed after the command completes.

## :bulb: Ideas For Further Releases
- Allow working with the app by using only the keyboard (with correct Tabs, Esc and so on work).
- Exclude sub-directories from the command running.
- Allow export and import config.
- Release version for Linux and macOS.
